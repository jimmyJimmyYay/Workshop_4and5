1. If you would've used the Property types rather than the primitive data types?
Using `Property` types like `SimpleStringProperty` over `String` would be useful in JavaFX applications.
Property types enable automatic UI updating when data is changed without manually refreshing UI components.
The application would then be more responsive and less dependent on explicit listener management.
In this specific project, since the data isn't being dynamically updated in the UI,
using primitive data types is acceptable and is more efficient with less overhead.

2. What was the most challenging aspect of working with inventory limits?
The most challenging aspect of working with inventory limits was making sure that
stock quantities met the required `min` and `max` values. Including validation logic to prevent incorrect data entry
was essential. For instance, preventing users from setting `min` greater than `max` or
inputting stock quantities outside this range required careful error handling and user-friendly alerts.

3. How did you ensure the application prevents invalid operations?
A number of validation checks were employed to prevent invalid operations from occurring:
- Inventory Constraints: Triggers are established if the inventories are more than `max` or less than `min`.
- Product-Part Relationship: Deleting a product is impossible if it has parts.
- Price Constraints: The total of the price of the products cannot be lower than the prices of its parts.
- Confirmation Dialogs: Implemented for delete and cancel operations so that data is not lost by mistake.
- Required Fields: Checking each product has a name, price, and stock value before saving.

All these checks secure the integrity of data and ensure no logical mistakes are made in managing inventory.
